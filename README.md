This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This application presents an interactive map that dynamically displays air quality data and heatmaps, with a primary emphasis on providing detailed insights into the air quality across various regions in Africa. The data visualization techniques employed allow for an intuitive understanding of air quality metrics, contributing to environmental awareness and informed decision-making.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
